Will couple the Notion page called Bug tracking from the Notion templates to Github issues
Essentially each new page created there will be made into an issue in Github with the appropriate label
It is important we keep everything as it curretly is so everyone has the same setup

For example:

Rejected -> wont fix 
To reveiw -> no label
Validating -> no label
Tasks backlog -> no label

In the descrption include: Reported by: Name

Will not assing to anyone 

Type, if its Improvement or Feature -> enhancement
      if its Issue -> bug
